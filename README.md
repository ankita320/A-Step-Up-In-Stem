        <p class= "pi">Hello, my name is Ankita Saha and I go by She/Her. I am currently an 8th grader in NYC. I joined a coding program Kode With Klossy last summer and there I was able to learn so much information about women in STEM and the diversity in STEM. That inspired my to create something that would help others gain information about this and what they can do. Some people want to learn coding but are afraid of all the STEM stereotypes. However, with this platform, my sister an I hope to achieve a greater diversity in STEM and encourage those people to do what they love. Remember to empower, motivate, and inspire!  </p>
