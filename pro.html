        <h2 class= "go">The Issue</h2>
        <p class= "pi">The issue with the STEM field is that it lacks diversity. The root of this issue is that many people are afraid of STEM itself. They may think they can't do it or it will be too hard. A lot of people think this because of the stereotypes. Since so many people would think this way, they don't join the STEM field causing there to be a lack of diversity. There were will be a lack of diversity and more of one race or gender will be in the STEM field. Because of this,even more people will not want to join seeing the vast difference in teh percentages. It will continue to go on like this unless we do something. There won't be as great things created and most of all, many people will be afraid to join.   </p>

        <h2 class= "go">The Solution</h2>
        <p class= "pi">We can create a solution for this issue by encouraging other people to not be afraid of the stereotypes and to join STEM if they wish to. We can provide multiply resources which they can join and fell empowered and motivated. By doing this, we can create better diversity in STEM and bend the statistics so that there is equal percentages. We can share stories and motivate each other. We can build something important and massive. We can solve the problem!   </p>
